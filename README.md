# Linear-Algebra-Polito-Course

Computational linear algebra for large scale problems is the name course that hold in polito as one the math course presente in Data scince and engineering. This repo is explained three course that presented in the course.

# Project 1 - PCA  
(Simulating the typical situation in a company). With this homework we want to simulate (for example) the situation where a company wants to analyze the market and identify meaningful profiles of customers. Typically, all the information gathered from the history of sold/selling products must be summarized with few and easily-comprehensible concepts, in order to help the managers with future decisions. Then, in these situations, very often the number m of chosen Principal Components (PCs) is very low, giving more importance to the dimensionality reduction then the preservation of the information.  

We aim to answer the following two questions:    
1. Summarize the available data in order to make them easier to be interpreted. In particular, summarize the information in the with at most m = 5 features but (if possible) with at least 33% of preserved information.
2. Identify “customer profiles” according to the summarized features. Specifically, identify a minimum of 3 up to 10 profiles.

To address these questions, I follow these seven steps:
1. Loading and Preparing the Data
2. Encoding of Categorical Data
3. Preprocessing and full-PCA
4. Dimensionality Reduction and Interpretation of the PCs
5. k-Means
6. Clusters and Centroid Interpretation and Visualization
7. Clusters and Centroids Evaluation

You can find the code and the report the Project1 -PCA folder.



# Project 2 - Page Rank

3. A remedy for dim(V1(A)) > 1  
  3.1. A modification to the link matrix A  
  3.2. Analysis of the matrix M  
4. Computing the Importance Score Eigenvector  



# Project 3 - Image recunstruction using PCA and SVD
This research project investigates the comparative performance of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for the reconstruction of single grayscale images. The analysis will focus on two key metrics: reconstruction accuracy, measured by the Frobenius norm of the error. By applying both algorithms to a set of three identical-sized grayscale images, the project aims to gain a deeper understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses in this specific image reconstruction task.
